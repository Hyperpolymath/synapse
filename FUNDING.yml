# Funding Philosophy
# ------------------
# This project follows solidarity economics principles:
# 1. The software is free (as in freedom and beer)

# 3. Funds go to infrastructure and dependencies first
# 4. No individual enrichment from community work
#
# If you want to support Synapse financially:
# 1. Support the Zig Software Foundation
# 2. Support Rust ecosystem maintainers
# 3. Support Swift open source initiatives
# 4. Donate to digital rights organizations (EFF, FSF)
