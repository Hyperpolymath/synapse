= Synapse Governance
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

Synapse uses a lightweight governance model designed for a small, focused project. As the project grows, this model may evolve.

== Decision Making

=== Day-to-Day Decisions

* Made by any Core maintainer
* Documented in commit messages and issues
* Reversible without process

=== Significant Decisions

Require discussion and consensus:

* API changes
* New dependencies
* Architecture changes
* Release schedules

Process:

1. Open an issue with `[RFC]` prefix
2. Allow 7 days for discussion
3. Core maintainers reach consensus
4. Document decision in issue and relevant docs

=== Breaking Changes

Require:

1. RFC issue with 14-day discussion period
2. Unanimous Core maintainer approval
3. Migration guide
4. One version deprecation warning

== Roles

=== Core Maintainers

*Current Core Maintainers*: See MAINTAINERS.md

*Responsibilities*:

* Final merge authority
* Release management
* Security response
* Governance decisions
* Code of Conduct enforcement

*Selection*:

* Nomination by existing Core maintainer
* Demonstrated sustained contribution (12+ months)
* Unanimous approval by existing Core

*Removal*:

* Voluntary resignation
* 6+ months inactivity without notice
* Code of Conduct violation (per enforcement guidelines)
* Unanimous remaining Core decision

=== Expert Contributors

*Responsibilities*:

* Code review
* Mentoring new contributors
* Feature development

*Selection*:

* 10+ accepted contributions
* Nomination by Core maintainer
* Majority Core approval

=== Community Contributors

*Responsibilities*:

* Bug reports
* Feature requests
* Code contributions
* Documentation

*Selection*:

* Anyone who contributes

== Voting

When consensus cannot be reached:

1. Core maintainers vote
2. Simple majority wins
3. Ties broken by project founder (if active) or most senior maintainer

Voting is rare and indicates a process failure. Prefer consensus.

== Conflict Resolution

1. Direct discussion between parties
2. Mediation by uninvolved Core maintainer
3. Core maintainer vote
4. External mediation (last resort)

See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for behavioral conflicts.

== Financial Governance

=== Current Status

Synapse has no dedicated funding. Contributors donate their time.

=== If Funding Is Received

1. All funds held transparently (OpenCollective or similar)
2. Expenditures require Core maintainer approval
3. Priority: Infrastructure > Dependencies > Events > Swag
4. No individual compensation without unanimous Core approval
5. Annual financial report published

== Changes to Governance

1. Propose change via RFC issue
2. 30-day discussion period
3. Unanimous Core maintainer approval
4. Update this document

== Succession Planning

If all Core maintainers become inactive:

1. Most recent Expert contributor may assume Core role
2. If no Experts, most prolific Community contributor
3. Project may be archived if no successors

* Governance questions: Open issue with `governance` label
